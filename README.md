identifies simple concepts like start and end of a tag.

FAQ:
Why later option is not available in the license ?
Because at the time of this writing no other versions exists, and thus
I can't be sure I agree with them. Contact me if you have any license needs.

Why yet another xml library. I have found myself looking for xml libraries, or simple
parsers that could simply extract data between tags. Tags are a simple concept and being
able to have a 'easy' to use api is often far more important to prototype.
